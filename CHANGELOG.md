### Version 0.0.2

In this release you will be able to create a Screen and populate it with entities. 

Unfortunately we don't have proper documentation yet, but feel free to fiddle around with the provided example folder :D

* Got Screen concept functioning
* Got Entity concept functioning
* Wrote some tests via karma / jasmine
* Made a very basic example
* Added this changelog
* Added fake docs with no documentation

### Version 0.0.1

Pre alpha initial release, not really usable unless you know exactly what you're doing. Only madmen and those with nothing to lose should try to use this ;)

* Added a bunch of random stuff unusable to humans
