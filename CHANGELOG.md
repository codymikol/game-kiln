### Version 0.0.4

This version has added a lot of the super basic stuff that I wanted in before even showing this project to anyone. There is still a lot to do in terms of making a functional game framework, but this at least gives a fun playground for creating and controlling entities on the screen. :D

* Fixed README Markdown
* Got Mouse Input Working
* Got Keyboard Input Working
* Give Entities access to delta
* Bound loop to this in constructor
* Made intervals / timeouts bound to this
* Replaced Entity key methods with KInput
* Entities can destroy themselves
* Fixed Demo
* Removed Entity Key Logic
* Removed notes.txt

### Version 0.0.3

I messed up publishing something to npm and broke all the things, this just fixes that ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

### Version 0.0.2

Pre alpha release with a somewhat working demo. 

In this release you will be able to create a Screen and populate it with entities. 

Unfortunately we don't have proper documentation yet, but feel free to fiddle around with the provided example folder :D

* Got Screen concept functioning
* Got Entity concept functioning
* Wrote some tests via karma / jasmine
* Made a very basic example
* Added this changelog
* Added fake docs with no documentation

### Version 0.0.1

Pre alpha initial release, not really usable unless you know exactly what you're doing. Only madmen and those with nothing to lose should try to use this ;)

* Added a bunch of random stuff unusable to humans
