### Hello!
 
This is an engine for creating games on the web.
 
 Currently we are in pre-alpha, but plan to quickly move into an alpha state very soon.

### Things I need to do before sharing this with actual humans

1. Create useful docs
1. Make mouse input work
1. Make keyboard input work
1. Have a demo that actually resembles a game
1. Properly set up a publish script
1. Set up a neat little website
1. Make Entity child / parent relationships function properly
1. Fix weirdness around interval / timeout bindings
1. Make a cool icon / logo
1. Write a lot more tests so it's not so wild in here

### If you'd like to contribute

I'm hacking and slashing away at this thing so feel free to shoot me an email at codymikol@gmal.com so I can stop making completely outrageous amounts of changes and treat this like a community project :p
